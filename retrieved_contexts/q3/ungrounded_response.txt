The APOE gene, which is associated with cholesterol metabolism and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, has several variants. Of these, the ε4 variant (often simply referred to as E4) is of particular interest because it's linked to an increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

The prevalence of the ε4 allele varies widely among different populations. In many populations, around 10-15% of individuals carry at least one ε4 allele. However, it's essential to highlight that having the ε4 allele doesn't guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer's disease; it merely increases the risk. Conversely, not having the ε4 allele doesn't mean someone won't develop the disease.

The frequency can be higher or lower depending on specific populations and ethnic backgrounds. For instance, certain populations might have a much lower prevalence of the ε4 allele, while others could have a higher prevalence.

If you or a loved one are considering genetic testing related to Alzheimer's risk or any other health concerns, it's crucial to understand the implications and limitations of such results. It's always recommended to work with a genetic counselor or other medical professional who can provide guidance tailored to individual circumstances.
