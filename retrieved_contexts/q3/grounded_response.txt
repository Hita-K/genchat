In terms of the broader population, E4 is a fairly common version of the APOE gene. E3 is the most prevalent type, while E2 is the least common. To put it in perspective for you, about 20% of individuals in the general population have one copy of the E4 allele, much like many others participating in the study. A smaller group, around 2-4%, has two copies of the E4 allele, just like you. It's essential to remember that while the E4 allele does increase the risk for mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's-related dementia, it's not a definitive marker. Many people with the E4 allele never develop any symptoms. There's still much we're learning about the complexities of how genes and environmental factors interact. You're not alone in this, and many participants in the study are on this journey of understanding alongside you.
