* The genetic counselor explains that E3 is the most common ApoE allele, E2 is rare, and E4 falls in the middle.
* The study is interested in individuals with one or two copies of the E4 allele.
* 20% of the general population has one copy of E4, and 2-4% have two copies.
* The E4 allele is the only one associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
* Having the E4 allele is a risk factor, but it's not a definitive identifier for developing dementia.

* The genetic counselor explains that the APOE gene comes in three types: E2, E3, and E4.
* E2 is the least common in the population.
* E3 is the most common.
* E4 is also a common type of the gene.

* The ApoE gene comes in three versions, E2, E3, and E4.
* Everyone has two copies of the ApoE gene, one from each parent.
* There are six possible combinations of ApoE genotypes: E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4, E3/E3, E3/E4, and E4/E4.
* The E4 version of the ApoE gene is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
