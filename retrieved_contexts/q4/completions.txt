Early-onset Alzheimer's typically refers to individuals who develop symptoms before the age of 65. Now, considering the data we discussed, many people, even with two copies of the E4 variant, like you, don't show symptoms until between ages 65-85. That's a range in which the risk is highest. However, it's essential to understand that these numbers are based on large studies and there's a level of uncertainty. Just as 30-55 out of 100 people with your APOE result might develop symptoms, 45-70 might not. It's also worth noting that those lifestyle changes we talked about have been shown to potentially reduce the risk, highlighting how other factors come into play. We're all different, and individual experiences may vary.
