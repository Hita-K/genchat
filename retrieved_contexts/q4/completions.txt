It is difficult to give an exact age for early onset Alzheimer's, as it can vary from person to person. Generally, the risk of developing Alzheimer's increases with age, and the risk is highest between ages 65-85. However, it is important to remember that having the ApoE E4 gene does not guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer's, and that there are other factors that can influence the risk.
