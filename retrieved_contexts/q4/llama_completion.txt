Hello again! I understand that you're interested in understanding what age is considered early for early onset Alzheimer's. Based on the information provided, let me summarize the risk estimate for developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease:

The risk estimate provided is 30-55% up to age 85, which means that out of 100 people with the same APOE result, 30-55 of them are expected to develop symptoms, while 45-70% will not. It's important to acknowledge that this risk estimate is an estimate and not a guarantee, and that other factors can also contribute to the development of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.

Describing scope of risk:

The risk estimate provided is based on a lifetime risk up to age 85, which means that the risk is highest between ages 65-85. It's important to note that the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease increases with age, and that lifestyle changes such as exercise, a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, and quitting smoking may help reduce the risk.

Distilling definitions into “take home messages”:

* The risk estimate provided is an estimate and not a guarantee.
* The risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease increases with age, and is highest between ages 65-85.
* Lifestyle changes may help reduce the risk.

Acknowledging uncertainty of risk:

It's important to acknowledge that the risk estimate provided is based on a single large study and other data, and that the actual risk may be different for each individual. Additionally, other factors can also contribute to the development of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, and it's important to discuss your specific risk factors and concerns with a healthcare professional.

I hope this information helps provide some clarity. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional.
