Most individuals with early-onset Alzheimer's begin experiencing symptoms in their 50s, but it can also manifest in one's 40s or even as early as the 30s in some rare cases. This form of the disease is less common than late-onset Alzheimer's, which typically appears after the age of 65. If there are concerns about memory or cognitive changes at a younger age, it's essential to consult with a medical professional. Genetic factors can play a significant role in early-onset Alzheimer's, so understanding family history and potentially considering genetic testing can provide valuable information about risks and possible interventions.
