Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that there are different genetic makeups associated with the ApoE gene, and they have varying levels of risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.* The counselor mentions that the E4 E4 type, which is present in 2-4% of the general population, has a risk of 30-55% of developing Alzheimer's.* The counselor also notes that the E3 E4 type has a risk of 20-25%, which is about half the risk of the E4 E4 type.* The counselor states that the other combinations of the ApoE gene have a low risk of 10-15% or less.Overall, the counselor is explaining that the specific combination of the ApoE gene can impact the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and that some combinations have a higher risk than others.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that the information they are providing about ApoE and Alzheimer's risk is based on a large population study.* The counselor notes that the study is a compilation of data from a large population, and that the numbers they are quoting are based on this study.* The counselor acknowledges that there may be other studies with different numbers, but notes that those studies are typically smaller and may overestimate the risk.* The counselor emphasizes that they are careful in choosing the most accurate data available.Overall, the counselor is explaining the basis for the information they are providing about ApoE and Alzheimer's risk, and emphasizing that they are relying on a large, reliable study to provide accurate information to the patient.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that ApoE is just one risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and that there are other modifiers of risk that can impact an individual's likelihood of developing the condition.* The counselor notes that family history is another risk factor that cannot be controlled.* The counselor mentions that age is also a risk factor, as the aging process itself increases the risk of dementia.* The counselor states that being female is another risk factor that cannot be controlled.* The counselor explains that education and lifestyle are modifiable risk factors, and that staying mentally stimulated and active throughout life can help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.* The counselor notes that cardiovascular health is another modifiable risk factor, and encourages the patient to maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's.Overall, the counselor is emphasizing that while ApoE is a risk factor for Alzheimer's, there are other factors that can impact an individual's likelihood of developing the condition, and that some of these factors can be controlled or modified through lifestyle choices and healthy habits.
