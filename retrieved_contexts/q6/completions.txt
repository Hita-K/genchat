Based on your genetic profile, your children will definitely inherit one copy of the E4 variant from you. However, without knowing the genetic status of their other parent, we cannot determine what the second copy of the ApoE gene will be for your children.

It's important to understand that while inheriting an E4 variant does increase their risk for mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, it doesn't guarantee it. If we look at the bigger picture, individuals with two copies of the E4 variant have a 30-55% risk of developing symptoms by age 85. This means there's a 45-70% chance they may not develop Alzheimer's. Various factors influence the onset and progression of the disease.

Discussing your results with your children when they're ready can be crucial, as it might have broader implications for their health choices and future planning. While the information brings a certain level of uncertainty, understanding the scope of the risk can help make informed decisions.
