Each person has two copies of the APOE gene, one inherited from each parent. The APOE gene has three main variants (or alleles): ε2, ε3, and ε4.

If you've had genetic testing that provided your APOE status, you'll have two of these alleles. For example, you might have an ε3/ε4 combination or an ε2/ε3 combination.

Your children will inherit one APOE allele from you and one from their other parent. So, while they will inherit one of your two alleles, they may not necessarily have the same combination as you, depending on what alleles their other parent contributes.

For instance, if you have an ε3/ε4 combination and your partner has an ε3/ε3 combination, your child could inherit the ε3 allele from both of you (ending up with an ε3/ε3 combination) or could inherit the ε4 allele from you and the ε3 allele from your partner (resulting in an ε3/ε4 combination).

In summary, your children will inherit one of your APOE alleles, but their exact APOE result will also depend on the genetic contribution from their other parent. If you have concerns or questions about the potential genetic risks for your children, a detailed discussion with a genetic counselor can provide clarity and guidance tailored to your family's specific situation.
