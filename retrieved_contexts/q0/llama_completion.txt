Hello there! I understand that you're looking for information on other genes that may pose a risk to dementia, given that you have two copies of the ApoE E4 allele. It's important to note that while the E4 type of the ApoE gene is a risk factor for developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, other genes can also contribute to the development of these conditions.

Research has identified several other genes that may increase the risk of dementia, including:

1. APP: The APP gene provides instructions for making a protein called amyloid precursor protein, which is involved in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. These plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.
2. PS1: The PS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 1, which is involved in the breakdown of amyloid beta protein in the brain. Mutations in the PS1 gene can lead to the accumulation of amyloid beta protein and increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
3. PS2: The PS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called presenilin 2, which is also involved in the breakdown of amyloid beta protein in the brain. Mutations in the PS2 gene can also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
4. APOE: As we've already discussed, the APOE gene is a risk factor for developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
5. TOMM40: The TOMM40 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TOMM40, which is involved in the breakdown of amyloid beta protein in the brain. Variations in the TOMM40 gene have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.

It's important to keep in mind that the risk of developing dementia is not solely determined by genetics. Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and social engagement, can also play a role in reducing the risk of cognitive decline.

I hope this information helps you understand the scope of risk factors for dementia. It's important to remember that while having two copies of the ApoE E4 allele does increase your risk, there are other factors at play, and it's not a guarantee that you will develop dementia. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional.
