While APOE is the most well-known and best-studied genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, there are other genes that have been identified to be associated with Alzheimer's risk. However, the impact of these genes on overall risk is generally much smaller compared to APOE.

When we discuss the scope of risk, it's important to understand that most other genes contribute a relatively minor increase or decrease in Alzheimer's risk. The combined effects of these other genes may influence one's overall risk, but they don't confer the same level of risk as the APOE E4 variant.

Considering the broader effects of risk, it's essential to remember that genetics is just one piece of the puzzle. An individual's overall risk is shaped by a combination of genetic factors, environmental influences, lifestyle choices, and health conditions. Even with the presence of multiple risk genes, other factors like maintaining good cardiovascular health and managing conditions like diabetes can play a pivotal role in modifying the risk.
