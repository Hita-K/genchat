Yes, there are other genes that can pose a risk to dementia, such as family history, age, gender, education, cardiovascular disease, and certain conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. These factors can increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and lifestyle changes such as exercise, a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, and quitting smoking can help reduce the risk. Additionally, the ApoE gene is one of many thousands of genes in the body, and it comes in three different versions, or alleles: E2, E3, and E4. Having the E4 allele is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, but it's not a definitive identifier.
