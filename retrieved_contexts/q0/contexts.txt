* The patient has learned that they have 2 E4 genes, which means they have an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
* The genetic counselor explains that the risk estimate is 30-55% for developing these conditions by age 85, based solely on the APOE result.
* The counselor also notes that this means the patient has a 45-70% estimated risk of not developing these conditions.
* The counselor emphasizes that this is a risk estimate and not a guarantee, and that it's important to keep in mind that other factors can also contribute to the development of cognitive impairment or dementia.

* The genetic counselor explains that there are other factors that can modify an individual's risk for Alzheimer's disease, in addition to the ApoE gene.
* These factors include family history, gender, years of education, health history (such as cardiovascular health and diabetes), and age.
* These factors can either increase or decrease an individual's risk for Alzheimer's disease.
* The counselor emphasizes that it's important to consider these factors when assessing an individual's overall risk for Alzheimer's disease, in addition to their ApoE status.

* The genetic counselor explains that certain factors can increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, including:
	* Family history of dementia or Alzheimer's
	* Older age
	* Female gender
	* Fewer years of education
	* Cardiovascular disease
	* Conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure

These factors can "push" a person closer to the 55% end of the risk range, indicating that they may be more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.
