Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits, mainly amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which interfere with neuronal function. Over time, these deposits cause neurons to lose their connections and eventually die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. Picture it like a garden where some plants start to wither and the pathways between them become obstructed. But remember, not every garden with these signs will end up in disarray. Many gardens, or in this case brains, remain resilient.
