Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that affects the brain, leading to a decline in cognitive abilities such as memory, thinking, language, problem-solving, and decision-making. It is the most common cause of dementia, and it can cause changes in the brain such as the buildup of plaques and tangles. While having the ApoE E4 gene is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's, it is not a definitive predictor of who will or will not develop the condition. It is important to remember that there is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to predicting who will develop Alzheimer's, and it is important to take steps to promote healthy brain aging.
