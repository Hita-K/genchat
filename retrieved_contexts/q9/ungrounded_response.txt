Alzheimer's disease results in distinct changes within the brain at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels, which are characteristic of the disease.

At a microscopic level, Alzheimer's is marked by the accumulation of two types of abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Amyloid plaques are sticky clumps of protein fragments that accumulate outside of nerve cells, or neurons. These plaques may disrupt cell function and trigger inflammation, leading to neuron damage. Tau tangles, on the other hand, are twisted fibers that form inside neurons. They result from the abnormal buildup and twisting of a protein called tau. These tangles can block the neuron's transport system, impeding nutrient and other essential molecule movement, leading to cell death.

On a more macroscopic level, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, significant brain atrophy or shrinkage occurs. This is especially noticeable in the brain's hippocampus, an area crucial for memory formation. As more neurons die due to the disease, the affected brain regions start to shrink, leading to a decline in cognitive functions. Over time, this shrinkage becomes more widespread, which is often evident when comparing brain scans of healthy individuals to those with advanced Alzheimer's.

Fluid-filled spaces in the brain called ventricles also enlarge as the brain tissue decreases. Moreover, the disease may disrupt the usual activity and connectivity between different brain regions, impairing communication between neurons.

Understanding the changes that Alzheimer's disease causes in the brain is crucial for its diagnosis and ongoing research into potential treatments. If you or a loved one have concerns about Alzheimer's or are considering pursuing more detailed diagnostic procedures, it's essential to consult with medical professionals familiar with the disease.
