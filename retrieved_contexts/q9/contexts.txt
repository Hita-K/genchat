* The genetic counselor mentions that the lifestyle changes they discussed (exercise, heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, quitting smoking) are based on research aimed at finding ways to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
* The counselor notes that the risk estimate of 30-55% for developing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease by age 85 is based primarily on a single large study that was reviewed along with other data to determine the most accurate risk estimates.
* The counselor emphasizes that the risk estimate is an estimate and not a guarantee, and that other factors can also contribute to the development of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.

* If the patient has two copies of the E4 variant (one from each parent), their risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is increased.
* The patient's estimated risk of developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease through age 85 is 30-55%.
* This means that out of 100 people with the same APOE result, 30-55 of them are expected to develop symptoms, while 45-70% will not.

* The patient has received an E4, E4 result on their ApoE test, which indicates a higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
* The genetic counselor explains that the patient's estimated risk of developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's is 30-55% through age 85.
* The counselor also highlights that this means the patient has a 45-70% estimated risk of not developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's, which they encourage the patient to look at as a "glass half full" perspective.
