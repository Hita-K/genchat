With the specific E4 E4 makeup that you have, the estimated risk for developing Alzheimer's disease by age 85 falls between 30-55%. This means there's a significant chance, between 45-70%, that you may not develop Alzheimer's by that age. For those with the E3 E4 combination, the risk is approximately 20-25%. Other APOE combinations generally have a risk of 10-15% or even less.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that these risk estimations are not absolutes. They don't account for lifestyle, environmental factors, or other potential genetic influences that may either increase or decrease the risk. It's a complex interplay of multiple factors. Knowing your genetic information can certainly guide prevention and wellness efforts, but it's just one part of the broader picture of your health.
