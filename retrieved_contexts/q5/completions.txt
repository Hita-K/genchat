The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease with two APoE E4 genes is estimated to be between 30-55%, up to age 85. However, it is important to keep in mind that this is an estimate and not a definitive prediction. There are many other factors that can modify the risk, such as family history, age, gender, education, lifestyle, and cardiovascular health, and some of these factors can be controlled or modified. Ultimately, it is important to be aware of the risk factors and take steps to control them, while also acknowledging the uncertainty of the risk.
