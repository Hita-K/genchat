* The ApoE gene is one of many potential risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
* The presence of two copies of the E4 variant (one from each parent) increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but it's not the only factor that contributes to the risk.
* The risk estimate for developing Alzheimer's disease based on ApoE status is a range of 30-55% by age 85, but this does not take into account other factors that may modify an individual's personal risk.
* Other factors, such as lifestyle and environmental factors, may also play a role in an individual's risk for Alzheimer's disease.
* The genetic counselor emphasizes that the ApoE test result is just one piece of information to consider when assessing an individual's risk for Alzheimer's disease.

* The genetic counselor explains that there are different genetic makeups associated with the ApoE gene, and they have varying levels of risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.
* The counselor mentions that the E4 E4 type, which is present in 2-4% of the general population, has a risk of 30-55% of developing Alzheimer's.
* The counselor also notes that the E3 E4 type has a risk of 20-25%, which is about half the risk of the E4 E4 type.
* The counselor states that the other combinations of the ApoE gene have a low risk of 10-15% or less.

Overall, the counselor is explaining that the specific combination of the ApoE gene can impact the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and that some combinations have a higher risk than others.

* The genetic counselor emphasizes that the decision to learn one's ApoE test result is a personal one and should be based on the individual's comfort level with the information and uncertainties involved.
* The counselor explains that for individuals with two copies of the E4 variant (one from each parent), the estimated risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is 30-55% by age 85.
* The counselor also notes that this means the estimated risk of not developing Alzheimer's disease is 45-70%.
* The counselor wants to ensure that the patient understands the risks and uncertainties involved in learning their ApoE test result and is comfortable with their decision to proceed.
