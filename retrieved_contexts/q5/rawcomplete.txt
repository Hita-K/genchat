The APOE gene plays a significant role in the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and it has three common alleles: ε2, ε3, and ε4.

APOE ε3 is considered the "neutral" allele, meaning that individuals with two ε3 alleles (ε3/ε3) have an average risk of developing Alzheimer's disease relative to the general population.

APOE ε4 is associated with an increased risk. Having one ε4 allele (ε3/ε4) increases your risk compared to those with ε3/ε3, and having two ε4 alleles (ε4/ε4) further increases this risk. It's worth noting that not everyone with one or even two ε4 alleles will develop Alzheimer's disease; it merely increases the likelihood. Many other factors, including other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, come into play.

Conversely, APOE ε2 is considered protective. Individuals with at least one ε2 allele, such as ε2/ε3 or ε2/ε2, tend to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those with ε3/ε3. However, the presence of an ε2 allele doesn't guarantee protection; it only reduces the risk.

Remember that while APOE is a significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, it is not deterministic. Many individuals with ε4 alleles never develop the disease, and some without ε4 alleles do. It's a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and lifestyle. If you or a loved one have concerns about your APOE status and risk for Alzheimer's, consulting with a medical professional can provide a clearer understanding and guidance on potential preventive measures.
