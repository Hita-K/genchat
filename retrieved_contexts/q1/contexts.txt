* The genetic counselor is discussing cognitive changes that can occur as people age, including memory, thinking, language, problem-solving, and decision-making.
* The counselor explains that cognitive changes can be expected as people age normally, but there is also a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that can occur, which is a small but noticeable decline in cognition.
* MCI can have three possible outcomes: remaining stable, returning to normal aging, or progressing to dementia.
* Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life, and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.
* The counselor is focused on discussing Alzheimer's disease specifically.
