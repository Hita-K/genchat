* The counselor explains that cognitive changes can be expected as people age normally, but there is also a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that can occur, which is a small but noticeable decline in cognition.
* MCI can have three possible outcomes: remaining stable, returning to normal aging, or progressing to dementia.
* Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life, and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor is discussing a prevention study for people who are currently aging normally and do not have a diagnosis of cognitive impairment.
* The study aims to prevent people from being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease.
* Mild cognitive impairment is not a type of dementia, but rather a condition where a person's cognitive abilities are not as sharp as they used to be, but still not severe enough to interfere with daily life.
* Dementia is a general term used to describe cognitive decline severe enough to interfere with daily life, and there are many different causes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause.
