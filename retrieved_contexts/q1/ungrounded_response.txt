Dementia is a general term that describes a group of symptoms related to memory loss, thinking, and social abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life. It is not a specific disease in itself but rather a clinical syndrome, meaning a group of symptoms that occur together. There are various causes of dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common cause.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be seen as an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more pronounced decline of dementia. People with MCI have noticeable memory problems or other cognitive issues that are more significant than typical age-related changes, but these issues are not severe enough to interfere significantly with daily life. Not everyone with MCI will progress to dementia, but they are at an increased risk.

Alzheimer's disease, on the other hand, is a specific type of dementia. It's a progressive neurological disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline. It is characterized by the abnormal buildup of proteins in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, it's essential to remember that not all dementia is due to Alzheimer's. There are other causes, such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia, among others.
