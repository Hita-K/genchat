Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life, and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition that can be considered a middle ground between normal aging and dementia, and some people with MCI may progress to dementia in the future. Having one or two copies of the ApoE4 gene increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, but it's not a guarantee. The estimated risk of developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease through age 85 is 30-55%.
