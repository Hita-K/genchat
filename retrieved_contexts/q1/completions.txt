You know how as we age, we might notice changes in our abilities to remember names or misplace our keys? That's a part of the normal aging process. But, imagine a friend from our study group who starts to have slightly more pronounced memory challenges, maybe forgetting the topic of a conversation they just had. That's what we call mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. It’s like being in between normal aging and something more severe. Some of our study participants with MCI might find that over time, their cognitive function either stays the same, improves back to what we'd expect with normal aging, or it could progress further.

Now, imagine another friend from our group who not only forgets conversations but also struggles with daily activities, like getting dressed or preparing a meal. That's what we refer to as dementia. Dementia isn’t a specific disease itself, but a broad term describing a set of symptoms that significantly impact daily living.

Among the various causes of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is the most common. So, if we were to picture dementia as an umbrella, Alzheimer's disease would be one of the main spokes holding it up.

To sum it up: MCI is like a gray zone, a bit beyond normal aging but not as severe as dementia. Dementia, including Alzheimer’s, affects daily life much more profoundly. Since you've come to learn about the APOE E4 genes, it shows you're already informed about the risk factors. This knowledge can be empowering and help you better understand where you might fit in the larger picture of our study and the community of participants.
