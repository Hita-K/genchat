* The genetic counselor is discussing the results of a genetic test, specifically the ApoE test, with a patient.* The counselor defines cognition as the brain's abilities, such as memory, thinking, language, problem solving, and decision making.* The counselor explains that there are three categories of cognition: normal brain changes that occur with aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia.* The counselor notes that normal brain changes with aging are expected and can affect memory, cognitive abilities, and other brain functions.* The counselor highlights the importance of understanding the different categories of cognition to accurately assess and interpret the results of the ApoE test.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor is discussing the results of a genetic test, specifically the ApoE test, with a patient.* The counselor explains that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a noticeable and measurable decline in cognition that is not yet dementia.* The counselor notes that MCI is a middle ground between normal cognitive aging and dementia.* The counselor highlights the importance of early detection and monitoring of MCI, as it can potentially progress to dementia over time.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor is discussing the results of a genetic test, specifically the ApoE test, with a patient.* The counselor explains that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can have three outcomes: stability, return to normal brain aging, or progression to dementia.* The counselor notes that dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life, and that there are many different causes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause.* The counselor highlights the focus of the discussion, which is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene and its role in Alzheimer's disease.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor is discussing the results of a genetic test, specifically the ApoE test, with a patient.* The counselor explains that the patient's family history of dementia on their mother's side is not necessarily due to Alzheimer's disease, but could be due to something else.* The counselor notes that even if the patient chooses to learn their ApoE test result, it may not fully explain the family history of dementia.* The counselor asks the patient if they have any questions about this uncertainty.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor is discussing the ApoE gene with the patient.* The counselor explains that everyone has two copies of the ApoE gene, one from each parent.* The counselor notes that the ApoE gene comes in three different types: E2, E3, and E4.* The counselor explains that each person has one of six possible combinations of ApoE genotypes, with some people having no E4 copies, some having one E4 copy, and some having two E4 copies.

Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The patient has received an E4, E4 result on their ApoE test, which indicates a higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.* The genetic counselor explains that the patient's estimated risk of developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's is 30-55% through age 85.* The counselor also highlights that this means the patient has a 45-70% estimated risk of not developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's, which they encourage the patient to look at as a "glass half full" perspective.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that the patient's siblings have not undergone genetic testing, and therefore their ApoE test results are unknown.* The counselor emphasizes that the only way to know their siblings' results would be if they were to undergo their own genetic testing.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that ApoE testing is not commonly done because there are no treatments or interventions available for individuals with the E4 variant.* The counselor mentions that some doctors may still choose to order the test, and
* The counselor also mentions that direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies may offer the test as part of their services, often through research studies.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor clarifies that the 30-55% risk estimate for developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is based on a single large research study.* The counselor notes that there is a wide range of information and risk estimates available online, but the 30-55% estimate is the most up-to-date and reliable information available.* The counselor emphasizes that the risk estimate is based on a review of the most up-to-date information available, and that it is important to keep in mind that this is an estimate and not a definitive prediction.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that the risk of developing MCI or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is in a range because various factors can modify the risk.* The counselor lists factors that can increase the risk, including:

Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor reassures the patient that learning their ApoE test result does not change who they are or their genetic makeup.* The counselor acknowledges that it's normal for patients to experience a range of emotions, such as feeling okay with the results one day and feeling down or anxious about them another day.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains the results of the patient's ApoE test:
	* E2 type: rare and protective, lowering the risk compared to the general population
	* E3 type: most common and neutral
	* No current proven medical benefit of testing the gene, not routinely tested in a doctor's office, but can provide information about risk.---
Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains the results of the patient's ApoE test:
	* E4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but it's not predictive, meaning it cannot guarantee that the patient will develop the condition.* The counselor outlines two scenarios:
		- Someone with zero copies of the risk factor could still develop symptoms, highlighting the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and the involvement of other factors such as lifestyle, environment, and multiple genes.- Someone with one or two copies of the risk factor might never develop symptoms.
