* The genetic counselor explains that ApoE test results can be categorized into three combinations: E2, E3, and E4.
* E2 combinations have the lowest risk of developing certain conditions, and E2 has been shown to actually lower someone's chances.
* E3 is the most common test result in the population and is seen quite often.
* E4 combinations are at the higher end of the risk spectrum.

* The genetic counselor explains that E3 is the most common ApoE allele, E2 is rare, and E4 falls in the middle.
* The study is interested in individuals with one or two copies of the E4 allele.
* 20% of the general population has one copy of E4, and 2-4% have two copies.
* The E4 allele is the only one associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
* Having the E4 allele is a risk factor, but it's not a definitive identifier for developing dementia.

* E4 is a risk factor for certain conditions, but having E4 does not necessarily mean that a person will develop symptoms.
* The genetic testing is not diagnostic, but rather a risk assessment that can indicate whether a person's chance of developing certain conditions is higher or lower than the general population.
* The counselor uses examples to illustrate that having no copies of E4 does not guarantee that a person will not develop symptoms, and having one or two copies of E4 does not guarantee that a person will develop symptoms.
