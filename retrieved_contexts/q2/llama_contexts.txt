Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that ApoE test results can be categorized into three combinations: E2, E3, and E4.
* E2 combinations have the lowest risk of developing certain conditions, and E2 has been shown to actually lower someone's chances.
* E3 is the most common test result in the population and is seen quite often.
* E4 combinations are at the higher end of the risk spectrum.

Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that E3 is the most common ApoE allele, E2 is rare, and E4 falls in the middle.
* The study is interested in individuals with one or two copies of the E4 allele.
* 20% of the general population has one copy of E4, and 2-4% have two copies.
* The E4 allele is the only one associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
* Having the E4 allele is a risk factor, but it's not a definitive identifier for developing dementia.

Sure, here's a summary of the important information in the transcription:

* The genetic counselor explains that the APOE gene comes in three types: E2, E3, and E4.
* E2 is the least common in the population.
* E3 is the most common.
* E4 is also a common type of the gene.
