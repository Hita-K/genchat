 The APOE gene plays a role in fat metabolism and has been associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, among other conditions.

E3 is the most common allele globally, with the majority of people inheriting two copies of E3 (one from each parent). In many populations, over 50% of individuals have this genotype (E3/E3).

E4 is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If you inherit one copy of the E4 allele, your risk is increased, and if you inherit two copies, your risk is even higher. Around 20-25% of the general population carries at least one E4 allele.

E2 is the least common of the three alleles and is associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Only a small fraction of the population carries the E2 allele, with estimates suggesting less than 10% have at least one copy.
