When we look at the ApoE alleles, E3 is the most common, with a vast majority of people carrying it. E2 is on the rarer side, which means fewer people have it. E4 is somewhere in the middle. To give you a clearer picture, about 20% of the general population has one E4 allele. Now, when we talk about having two E4 alleles, like you do, only about 2-4% of the population falls into that category.

It's important to note that these percentages just give an overview of the genetic landscape; they don't predict outcomes for individuals. Think of it like this: just because you're part of that 2-4% doesn't mean you're on a set path towards a particular condition. Genes, including E4, are merely one of many factors influencing our health. The presence of E4 does indicate a higher risk for certain conditions, specifically mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's-related dementia. But it's essential to remember that "risk" doesn't mean "certainty." It's similar to how some people might have a family history of a condition but never develop it themselves.

I often remind individuals that genetic testing, like this, gives us a risk assessment. It's like looking at the weather forecast; a higher chance of rain doesn’t always mean it will rain. Similarly, carrying the E4 allele increases the likelihood but doesn't determine if one will develop symptoms. The human body is complex, and many factors, both genetic and environmental, play a role in our overall health.
