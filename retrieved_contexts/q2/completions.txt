The ApoE gene comes in three different types: E2, E3, and E4. E3 is the most common type and is seen quite often. E4 is at the higher end of the risk spectrum, meaning that out of 100 people with the same ApoE result, 30-55 of them are expected to develop symptoms, while 45-70% will not. It's important to remember that having two copies of the E4 variant (E4/E4) does not guarantee that the patient will develop certain conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, and that the risk is not 100%. There are other factors that can increase or decrease the risk, such as family history, age, gender, education level, and heart health. It's important to stay informed and take steps to reduce risk, such as engaging in activities that will keep the body and brain active, exercising, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, and not smoking.
