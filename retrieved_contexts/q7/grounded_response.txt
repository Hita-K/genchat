 It's essential to understand that the 30-55% risk estimate for developing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease by age 85 is based mainly on a specific large study, among other data. This estimate is just that—an estimate. It's not a guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer's, and there are various factors, both genetic and environmental, that can influence one's risk.

With two APOE E4 genes, while your genetic predisposition might be higher, there are actionable steps you can take to possibly reduce your risk. Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a heart-healthy diet, managing stress, and if you smoke, quitting, are all strategies grounded in research aimed at promoting healthy brain aging. Additionally, addressing conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure can be beneficial, as these can push one closer to the higher end of the risk spectrum. Being proactive in these areas can serve as a defense against the potential onset of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
