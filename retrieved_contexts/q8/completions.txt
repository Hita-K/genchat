It is difficult to predict exactly how much memory loss is equivalent to just aging normally, as everyone's experience with aging is different. However, it is important to note that having two copies of the ApoE E4 gene increases the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This means that the patient may experience more memory loss than someone without the gene. It is important to remember that having the gene does not guarantee that the patient will develop Alzheimer's disease, but it does increase their risk.
