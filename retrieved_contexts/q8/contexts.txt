* The genetic counselor explains that the patient's estimated risk of developing mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is 30-55% up to age 85.
* This risk is based on the patient's ApoE test result and is calculated as a lifetime risk.
* The counselor also notes that the chance of not developing these symptoms is 45-70%.
* The risk is highest between ages 65-85.

* The genetic counselor is discussing cognitive changes that can occur as people age, including memory, thinking, language, problem-solving, and decision-making.
* The counselor explains that cognitive changes can be expected as people age normally, but there is also a condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that can occur, which is a small but noticeable decline in cognition.
* MCI can have three possible outcomes: remaining stable, returning to normal aging, or progressing to dementia.
* Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability that interferes with daily life, and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.
* The counselor is focused on discussing Alzheimer's disease specifically.

* The genetic counselor mentions that the lifestyle changes they discussed (exercise, heart-healthy diet, reducing stress, quitting smoking) are based on research aimed at finding ways to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
* The counselor notes that the risk estimate of 30-55% for developing mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease by age 85 is based primarily on a single large study that was reviewed along with other data to determine the most accurate risk estimates.
* The counselor emphasizes that the risk estimate is an estimate and not a guarantee, and that other factors can also contribute to the development of cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.
